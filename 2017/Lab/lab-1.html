<h1>6.824 Lab 1: MapReduce</h1>
<h3>Due: Friday February 17 at 11:59pm</h3>
</div>
<hr>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
In this lab you'll build a MapReduce library as an
introduction to programming in Go and to building fault
tolerant distributed systems. In the first part you will
write a simple MapReduce program.  In the second part you will
write a Master that hands out tasks to MapReduce workers, and handles
failures of workers.  The interface to the library and the
approach to fault tolerance is similar to the one described in
the original
<a href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce paper</a>.

<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>
You must write all the code you hand in for 6.824, except for code
that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to
look at anyone else's solution, and you are not allowed to look at
solutions from previous years. You may discuss the assignments with
other students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code. The
reason for this rule is that we believe you will learn the most by
designing and implementing your lab solution code yourself.

<p>
Please do not publish your code or make
it available to current or future 6.824 students.
<tt>github.com</tt> repositories are public by default, so please
don't put your code there unless you make the repository private. You
may find it convenient to use
<a href="https://github.mit.edu/">MIT's GitHub</a>,
but be sure to create a private repository.

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>
You'll implement this lab (and all the labs) in
<a href="http://www.golang.org/">Go</a>. The Go web site contains lots
of tutorial information which you may want to look at. It's probably
most convenient for you to install Go on your own computer and do your
development there. You can also use Go on Athena. We will grade your
labs using Go version 1.7; you should use 1.7 too, though we don't
know of any problems with other versions.

<p>
We supply you with parts of a MapReduce implementation that
supports both distributed and non-distributed operation (just
the boring bits). You'll fetch the initial lab software with
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> (a version control system).
To learn more about git, look at the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git book</a> or the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">git user's manual</a>,
or, if you are already familiar with other version control
systems, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented overview of git</a>
useful.

<p>
If you use Athena, you must use an x86 or x86_64 Athena machine; that
is,
<tt>uname -a</tt> should mention <tt>i386 GNU/Linux</tt> or
<tt>i686 GNU/Linux</tt> or <tt>x86_64 GNU/Linux</tt>. You can
log into a public i686 Athena host with
<tt>ssh athena.dialup.mit.edu</tt>. On Athena 
you should run these commands first:

<pre>
athena$ add git
athena$ setup ggo_v1.7
</pre>

<p>
The URL for the course git repository is
<tt>git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2017</tt>.
To install the files in your directory, you need to
<i>clone</i> the course repository, by running the commands
below.

<pre>
$ git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2017 6.824
$ cd 6.824
$ ls
Makefile src</pre>

<p>
Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.
For example, if you want to checkpoint your progress, you can
<em>commit</em> your changes by running:
<pre>
$ git commit -am 'partial solution to lab 1'</pre>

<p>
The Map/Reduce implementation we give you has support for two
modes of operation, <em>sequential</em> and
<em>distributed</em>. In the former, the map and reduce tasks
are executed one at a time: first, the first map task is
executed to completion, then the second, then the third, etc.
When all the map tasks have finished, the first reduce task is
run, then the second, etc. This mode, while not very fast, is
useful for debugging.
The distributed mode runs
many worker threads that first execute map tasks in parallel,
and then reduce tasks. This is much faster, but also harder to
implement and debug.

<h3>Preamble: Getting familiar with the source</h3>
<p>
The mapreduce package provides a simple Map/Reduce library.
Applications should normally call
Distributed() [located in master.go] to start a job, but may
instead call Sequential() [also in master.go] to get a
sequential execution for debugging.

<p>
The code executes a job as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The application provides a number of input files, a map
function, a reduce function, and the number of reduce
tasks (<tt>nReduce</tt>).
<li>
A master is created with this knowledge. It starts an
RPC server (see <tt>master_rpc.go</tt>), and waits for
workers to register (using the RPC call
<tt>Register()</tt> [defined in <tt>master.go</tt>]).
As tasks become available (in steps
4 and 5), <tt>schedule()</tt> [<tt>schedule.go</tt>]
decides how to assign those tasks to workers, and how to
handle worker failures.
<li>
The master considers each input file to be one map task, and
calls <tt>doMap()</tt>
[<tt>common_map.go</tt>] at least once for each map task. It
does so either directly (when using
<tt>Sequential()</tt>) or by issuing the <tt>DoTask</tt>
RPC to a worker [<tt>worker.go</tt>]. Each call to
<tt>doMap()</tt> reads the appropriate file, calls the
map function on that file's contents, and writes the
resulting key/value pairs to
<tt>nReduce</tt> intermediate files.
<tt>doMap()</tt> hashes each key to pick the intermediate
file and thus the reduce task that will process the key.
There
will be <tt>nMap</tt> x <tt>nReduce</tt> files after all map
tasks are done. Each file name contains a prefix, the map
task number, and the reduce task number. If there are
two map tasks and three reduce tasks, the map tasks
will create these six intermediate files:

<pre>
mrtmp.xxx-0-0
mrtmp.xxx-0-1
mrtmp.xxx-0-2
mrtmp.xxx-1-0
mrtmp.xxx-1-1
mrtmp.xxx-1-2
</pre>

Each worker must be able to read files written by any other worker, as
well as the input files. Real deployments use distributed storage
systems such as GFS to allow this access even though workers run on
different machines. In this lab you'll run all the workers on the same
machine, and use the local file system.

<li>
The master next calls <tt>doReduce()</tt>
[<tt>common_reduce.go</tt>] at least once for each
reduce task.  As with <tt>doMap()</tt>, it does so either
directly or through a worker. The <tt>doReduce()</tt>
for reduce task <tt>r</tt>
collects the <tt>r</tt>'th intermediate file from each map task,
and calls the reduce function for each key that appears in those files.
The reduce tasks produce <tt>nReduce</tt> result files.
<li>
The master calls <tt>mr.merge()</tt>
[<tt>master_splitmerge.go</tt>], which merges all the
<tt>nReduce</tt> files produced by the previous step
into a single output.
<li>
The master sends a Shutdown RPC to each of its workers,
and then shuts down its own RPC server.
</ol>

<p class="note">
Over the course of the following exercises, you will have to
write/modify <tt>doMap</tt>, <tt>doReduce</tt>, and
<tt>schedule</tt> yourself. These are located in
<tt>common_map.go</tt>, <tt>common_reduce.go</tt>, and
<tt>schedule.go</tt> respectively. You will also have to write
the map and reduce functions in <tt>../main/wc.go</tt>.

<p>
You should not need to modify any other files, but reading them
might be useful in order to understand how the other methods
fit into the overall architecture of the system.

<h3>Part I: Map/Reduce input and output</h3>
<p>The Map/Reduce implementation you are given is missing some
pieces. Before you can write your first Map/Reduce function
pair, you will need to fix the sequential implementation. In
particular, the code we give you is missing two crucial
pieces: the function that divides up the output of a map task,
and the function that gathers all the inputs for a reduce task.
These tasks are carried out by the <tt>doMap()</tt> function in
<tt>common_map.go</tt>, and the <tt>doReduce()</tt> function in
<tt>common_reduce.go</tt> respectively. The comments in those
files should point you in the right direction.

<p>
To help you determine if you have correctly implemented
<tt>doMap()</tt> and <tt>doReduce()</tt>, we have provided you
with a Go test suite that checks the correctness of your
implementation. These tests are implemented in the file
<tt>test_test.go</tt>. To run the tests for the sequential
implementation that you have now fixed, run:

<pre>
$ cd 6.824
$ export "GOPATH=$PWD"  # go needs $GOPATH to be set to the project's working directory
$ cd "$GOPATH/src/mapreduce"
$ go test -run Sequential
ok  	mapreduce	2.694s</pre>

<p class="todo">
You receive full credit for this part if your software passes
the Sequential tests (as run by the command above) when we run
your software on our machines.

<p>
If the output did not show <em>ok</em> next to the tests, your
implementation has a bug in it. To give more verbose output,
set <tt>debugEnabled = true</tt> in <tt>common.go</tt>, and add
<tt>-v</tt> to the test command above. You will get much more
output along the lines of:

<pre>
$ env "GOPATH=$PWD/../../" go test -v -run Sequential
=== RUN   TestSequentialSingle
master: Starting Map/Reduce task test
Merge: read mrtmp.test-res-0
master: Map/Reduce task completed
--- PASS: TestSequentialSingle (1.34s)
=== RUN   TestSequentialMany
master: Starting Map/Reduce task test
Merge: read mrtmp.test-res-0
Merge: read mrtmp.test-res-1
Merge: read mrtmp.test-res-2
master: Map/Reduce task completed
--- PASS: TestSequentialMany (1.33s)
PASS
ok  	mapreduce	2.672s</pre>

<h3>Part II: Single-worker word count</h3>
<p>
Now you will implement word count &mdash; a simple 
Map/Reduce example. Look in <tt>main/wc.go</tt>; you'll
find empty <tt>mapF()</tt> and <tt>reduceF()</tt> functions.
Your job is to insert code so that
<tt>wc.go</tt> reports the number of occurrences of each word
in its input.
A word is any contiguous sequence of letters, as
determined by
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsLetter"><tt>unicode.IsLetter</tt></a>.

<p>
There are some input files with pathnames of the form <tt>pg-*.txt</tt> in
~/6.824/src/main, downloaded from <a
href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/%3Fsort_order%3Ddownloads">Project
Gutenberg</a>.
Here's how to run <tt>wc</tt> with the input files:

<pre>
$ cd 6.824
$ export "GOPATH=$PWD"
$ cd "$GOPATH/src/main"
$ go run wc.go master sequential pg-*.txt
# command-line-arguments
./wc.go:14: missing return at end of function
./wc.go:21: missing return at end of function</pre>

<p>
The compilation fails because 
<tt>mapF()</tt> and
<tt>reduceF()</tt> are not complete.

<p>
Review Section 2 of the
<a href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce paper</a>.
Your <tt>mapF()</tt> and <tt>reduceF()</tt> functions will
differ a bit from those in the paper's Section 2.1. Your
<tt>mapF()</tt> will be passed the name of a file, as well as
that file's contents; it should split the contents into words, and return
a Go slice of <tt>mapreduce.KeyValue</tt>.
While you can choose what to put in the keys and values
for the <tt>mapF</tt> output, for word count it only makes sense
to use words as the keys.
Your <tt>reduceF()</tt> will be
called once for each key, with a slice of all the values
generated by <tt>mapF()</tt> for that key.
It must return a string containing the total number of occurences
of the key.

<ul class="hints">
<li>
a good read on what strings are in Go is the
<a href="http://blog.golang.org/strings">Go Blog on strings</a>.

<li>
you can use
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/strings/#FieldsFunc"><tt>strings.FieldsFunc</tt></a>
to split a string into components.

<li>
the strconv package
(<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/strconv/">http://golang.org/pkg/strconv/</a>)
is handy to convert strings to integers etc.
</ul>

<p>
You can test your solution using:
<pre>
$ cd "$GOPATH/src/main"
$ time go run wc.go master sequential pg-*.txt
master: Starting Map/Reduce task wcseq
Merge: read mrtmp.wcseq-res-0
Merge: read mrtmp.wcseq-res-1
Merge: read mrtmp.wcseq-res-2
master: Map/Reduce task completed
14.59user 3.78system 0:14.81elapsed</pre>

<p>
The output will be in the file "mrtmp.wcseq".
Your implementation is correct if the following command
produces the output shown here:
<pre>
$ sort -n -k2 mrtmp.wcseq | tail -10
he: 34077
was: 37044
that: 37495
I: 44502
in: 46092
a: 60558
to: 74357
of: 79727
and: 93990
the: 154024</pre>

<p>
You can
remove the output file and all intermediate files with:
<pre>$ rm mrtmp.*</pre>

<p>To make testing easy for you, run:
<pre>$ bash ./test-wc.sh</pre>
<p>and it will report if your solution is correct or not.

<p class="todo">
You receive full credit for this part if your Map/Reduce word
count output matches the correct output for the sequential
execution above when we run your software on our machines.

<h3>Part III: Distributing MapReduce tasks</h3>

 <p>
Your current implementation runs the map and reduce tasks one at a
time.
One of Map/Reduce's biggest selling points is that it
can automatically parallelize ordinary sequential code
without any extra work by the developer.
In this part of the lab, you will complete a version of
MapReduce that splits the work over a set of worker threads that run
in parallel on multiple cores. While not distributed across multiple
machines as in real Map/Reduce deployments, your implementation will
use RPC to simulate distributed computation.

<p>
The code in <tt>mapreduce/master.go</tt> does most of the work of
managing a MapReduce job. We also supply you with the complete code
for a worker thread, in <tt>mapreduce/worker.go</tt>, as well as some
code to deal with RPC in <tt>mapreduce/common_rpc.go</tt>.

<p>
Your job is to implement <tt>schedule()</tt>
in <tt>mapreduce/schedule.go</tt>. The master
calls <tt>schedule()</tt> twice during a MapReduce job, once for the
Map phase, and once for the Reduce phase. <tt>schedule()</tt>'s job is
to hand out tasks to the available workers. There will usually be more
tasks than worker threads, so <tt>schedule()</tt> must give each
worker a sequence of tasks, one at a time.
<tt>schedule()</tt> should wait until all tasks have completed, and
then return.

<p>
<tt>schedule()</tt> learns about the set of workers by reading
its <tt>registerChan</tt> argument. That channel yields a string for
each worker, containing the worker's RPC address. Some workers may
exist before <tt>schedule()</tt> is called, and some may start
while <tt>schedule()</tt> is running; all will appear on
<tt>registerChan</tt>. <tt>schedule()</tt> should use all the workers,
including ones that appear after it starts.

<p>
<tt>schedule()</tt> tells a worker to execute a task by sending
a <tt>Worker.DoTask</tt> RPC to the worker. This RPC's arguments are
defined by <tt>DoTaskArgs</tt> in <tt>mapreduce/common_rpc.go</tt>.
The <tt>File</tt> element is only used by Map tasks, and is the name
of the file to read; <tt>schedule()</tt> can find these file names
in <tt>mapFiles</tt>.

<p>
Use the <tt>call()</tt> function in <tt>mapreduce/common_rpc.go</tt>
to send an RPC to a worker. The first argument is the the worker's
address, as read from <tt>registerChan</tt>. The second argument
should be <tt>"Worker.DoTask"</tt>. The third argument should be
the <tt>DoTaskArgs</tt> structure, and the last argument should
be <tt>nil</tt>.

<p>
Your solution to Part III should only involve modifications
to <tt>schedule.go</tt>. If you modify other files as part of
debugging, please restore their original contents and then test before
submitting.

<p>
To test your solution, you should use the same Go test suite as
you did in Part I, but replace <tt>-run Sequential</tt>
with <tt>-run TestBasic</tt>. This will execute the distributed
test case without worker failures instead of the sequential
ones you ran before:
<pre>$ go test -run TestBasic</pre>

<p class="todo">
You receive full credit for this part if your software passes
<tt>TestBasic</tt> from <tt>test_test.go</tt> (the test you run
with the command above) when we run your software on our
machines.

<!--
<p>
You should also re-execute your word count application in a
distributed setting and verify that you still get the correct
output:
$ cd "$GOPATH/src/main"
$ go run wc.go master kjv12.txt localhost:7777
$ go run wc.go worker localhost:7777 localhost:7778 &
$ go run wc.go worker localhost:7777 localhost:7779 &
# wait for master to finish
$ bash ./test-wc.sh
Passed test
-->

<ul class="hints">
  
  <li> <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">RPC package</a> documents the
    Go RPC package.
    
<li><tt>schedule()</tt> should send RPCs to the workers in
parallel so that the workers can work on tasks
concurrently.  You will find the <tt>go</tt>
statement useful for this purpose; see 
<a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency">Concurrency in Go</a>.
<li>
<tt>schedule()</tt> must wait for a worker to
finish before it can give it another task. You
may find Go's channels useful.
<li>You may find 
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup">sync.WaitGroup</a>
useful.
<li>
The easiest way to track down bugs is to insert print state statements
(perhaps calling <tt>debug()</tt> in <tt>common.go</tt>), collect the output in
a file with
<tt>go test -run TestBasic &gt; out</tt>,
and then think about whether the output matches
your understanding of how your code should
behave. The last step (thinking) is the most
important.
<li>To check if your code has race conditions,
  run Go's <a href="https://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html">race detector</a> with your test:
<tt>go test -race -run TestBasic &gt; out</tt>.
</ul>

<p class="note">
The code we give you runs the workers as threads within a
single UNIX process, and can exploit multiple cores on a single
machine. Some modifications would be needed in order to run the
workers on multiple machines communicating over a network. The
RPCs would have to use TCP rather than UNIX-domain sockets;
there would need to be a way to start worker processes on all
the machines; and all the machines would have to share storage
through some kind of network file system.

<h3>Part IV: Handling worker failures</h3>

<p>
In this part you will make the master handle failed workers.
MapReduce makes this relatively easy because workers don't have
persistent state.  If a worker fails, any RPCs that the master
issued to that worker will fail (e.g., due to a timeout).
Thus, if the master's RPC to the worker fails, the master
should re-assign the task given to the failed worker to another
worker.

<p>
An RPC failure doesn't necessarily mean that the worker didn't execute
the task; the worker may have executed it but the reply was lost, or
the worker may still be executing but the master's RPC timed out.
Thus, it may happen that two workers receive the same task, compute
it, and generate output. Two invocations of a map or reduce function
are required to generate the same output for a given input (i.e. the
map and reduce functions are "functional"), so there won't be
inconsistencies if subsequent processing sometimes reads one output
and sometimes the other. In addition, the MapReduce framework ensures
that map and reduce function output appears atomically: the output
file will either not exist, or will contain the entire output of a
single execution of the map or reduce function (the lab code doesn't
actually implement this, but instead only fails workers at the end of
a task, so there aren't concurrent executions of a task).

<p class="note">
You don't have to handle failures of the master.
Making the master fault-tolerant is more
difficult because it keeps state that would have to
be recovered in order to resume operations after a master
failure. Much of the later labs are devoted to this challenge.

<p>
Your implementation must pass the two remaining test cases in
<tt>test_test.go</tt>. The first case tests the failure of one
worker, while the second test case tests handling of many
failures of workers. Periodically, the test cases start new
workers that the master can use to make forward progress, but
these workers fail after handling a few tasks. To run these
tests:
<pre>$ go test -run Failure</pre>

<p class="todo">
You receive full credit for this part if your software passes
the tests with worker failures (those run by the command above)
when we run your software on our machines.

<p>
Your solution to Part IV should only involve modifications to <tt>schedule.go</tt>.
If you modify other files as part of debugging, please restore their
original contents and then test before submitting.

<h3>Part V: Inverted index generation (optional for extra credit)</h3>
<div class="challenge">
<p>
For this optional challenge exercise, you will
build Map and Reduce functions for
generating an <em>inverted index</em>.

<p>
Inverted indices are widely used in computer science,
and are particularly useful in document searching.
Broadly speaking, an inverted index is a map from
interesting facts about the underlying data, to the
original location of that data. For example, in the
context of search, it might be a map from keywords to
documents that contain those words.

<p>
We have created a second binary in <tt>main/ii.go</tt>
that is very similar to the <tt>wc.go</tt> you built
earlier. You should modify <tt>mapF</tt> and
<tt>reduceF</tt> in <tt>main/ii.go</tt> so that they
together produce an inverted index. Running
<tt>ii.go</tt> should output a list of tuples, one per
line, in the following format:
<pre>
$ go run ii.go master sequential pg-*.txt
$ head -n5 mrtmp.iiseq
A: 16 pg-being_ernest.txt,pg-dorian_gray.txt,pg-dracula.txt,pg-emma.txt,pg-frankenstein.txt,pg-great_expectations.txt,pg-grimm.txt,pg-huckleberry_finn.txt,pg-les_miserables.txt,pg-metamorphosis.txt,pg-moby_dick.txt,pg-sherlock_holmes.txt,pg-tale_of_two_cities.txt,pg-tom_sawyer.txt,pg-ulysses.txt,pg-war_and_peace.txt

ABOUT: 2 pg-moby_dick.txt,pg-tom_sawyer.txt
ABRAHAM: 1 pg-dracula.txt
ABSOLUTE: 1 pg-les_miserables.txt</pre>

If it is not clear from the listing above, the format is:
<pre>word: #documents documents,sorted,and,separated,by,commas</pre>

For full credit on this challenge, you must pass
<tt>bash ./test-ii.sh</tt>, which runs:

<pre>
